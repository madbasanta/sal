 			Save an Amur Leopard (SAL) is a charity that has been set up to specifically save the leopard.  This elegant animal is one of the most elusive cats across the world.  In the last 15 years the number of leopards has declined by 20% and in 2017 it was noted that there are only 70 of these leopards left in the wild as their habitat is under threat from forest fires and land clearance to develop roads and manufacturing plants.

 		<p class="text-justify mt-2 mb-3">
 			The charity is funded solely through donations which can be made on a monthly basis or through an annual subscription.  Once you become an annual member you will receive a bi-monthly members pack which shows the incredible work the charity does do across the world, an Amur Leopard badge and a exclusive planet magazine three times a year

 			The charity works to restore the wildlife and the most threatened species across the world by working with countries to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate change.
